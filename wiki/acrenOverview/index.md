<h1>Acren Overview</h1>
Acren is a blockchain based open source platform that enables donations and investments for environmental protection in a secure and easy way.
Investors and donors are directly linked to an enabler (e.g. a farmer) who implements specific environmental measures.<br>
Acren ensures that the enabler implements the environmental measure.<br>
The enabler can offer a limited number of provable measures on Acren.
While some of these measures are aimed at making a profit (green investments), there are other activities that are not aimed at generating any kind of revenue (environmental donations).<br>
AcrenCoin enables donors and investors to participate financially in the growth of Acren.<br>
AcrenCoin is based on a modified form of a token bonding curve and can be obtained by any donor and investor.<br>
Donations through Acren are tax deductible.<br>
