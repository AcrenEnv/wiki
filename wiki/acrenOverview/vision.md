<h1>Vision</h1>

We must act now to protect the world for our next generations.<br>
Our vision is a future in which people work together and support each other to promote environmental protection.<br>
We strive for everyone to be willing to accept small sacrifices, such as minor profit cuts, small reductions in personal life, in an effort to invest in a greener world.<br>
Our vision is not a world where people have to make massive sacrifices, but to act as a community so that together we can make the world a better place for our future generations.
