<h1>Vision</h1>

We must act now to protect the world for our next generations.<br>
Our vision is a future in which people work together and support each other to promote environmental protection.<br>
We strive for each of us to accept small sacrifices, such as small losses of profit, small cutbacks in life, to invest in a better world.<br>
Our vision is not a world in which people have to suffer massive sacrifices, but we as a community take action so that together we can make the world a better place for our future generations.
