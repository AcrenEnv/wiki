# Welcome to Acren

**I welcome you on behalf of the entire [Acren](http://acren.org) community!**

With Acren, we aim to find a new way to improve environmental protection.  Environmental protection is one of the most important aspects of our time and we can all help!

As a decentralized platform (DApp),  Acren guarantees that donated and invested funds are used exclusively for environmental protection in a verifiable manner.

Through Acren, less money is wasted for administration and more money flows into actual environmental protection!

This Wiki serves as documentation of the entire Acren project. From our vision to the practical technical implementation we keep you up to date here. It is constantly updated.

In the [Calendar](../calendar) you can find our most important dates. Here we regularly list the most important online and offline events that might be of interest to you.
