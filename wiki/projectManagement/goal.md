<h1> Goal of system</h1>

<p>The aim of Acren is to bring farmers and donors together in order to enable donors to fund specific environmental measures and farmers to offer environmental measures. It should be ensured that donations are used solely for the intended purpose and that the donation process is transparent and traceable. </p>

<p>The AcrenToken is designed to enable investors to participate in the growth of Acren. Investors should benefit as the number of successfully implemented environmental protection measures increases. The AcrenToken ensures liquidity and the use of the funds of the token via a Token Bonding Curve [Link]. At the same time, all actions of an investor (buy, sell of the AcrenToken) should have a positive impact on environmental protection.</p>
